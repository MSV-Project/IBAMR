/*!
 * \brief Class PETScSAMRAIVectorReal is a class for wrapping
 * SAMRAI::solv::SAMRAIVectorReal objects so that they may be used with the <A
 * HREF="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc">PETSc</A> solver package.
 *
 * Class PETScSAMRAIVectorReal wraps a real-valued SAMRAI vector (see
 * SAMRAI::solv::SAMRAIVectorReal class) object so that it may be used with the
 * PETSc solver package.  A SAMRAI vector is defined as a collection of patch
 * data components and associated operations living on some subset of levels in
 * a structured AMR mesh hierarchy.
 *
 * Observe that there are only three public member functions in this class.
 * They are used to create and destroy PETSc vectors (i.e., \p Vec objects) and
 * to obtain the SAMRAI vector associated with the PETSc vector.  In particular,
 * note that the constructor and destructor of this class are protected members.
 * The construction and destruction of instances of this class may occur only
 * through the static member functions that create and destroy PETSc vector
 * objects.
 *
 * Finally, we remark that PETSc allows vectors with complex-valued entries.
 * This class and the class SAMRAI::solv::SAMRAIVectorReal assume real-values
 * vectors, i.e., data of type \p double or \p float.  The (currently
 * unimplemented) class PETScSAMRAIVectorComplex must be used for complex data.
 *
 * \see SAMRAI::solv::SAMRAIVectorReal
