     * \brief Solve the linear system of equations \f$Ax=b\f$ for \f$x\f$.
     *
     * Before calling solveSystem(), the form of the solution \a x and
     * right-hand-side \a b vectors must be set properly by the user on all
     * patch interiors on the specified range of levels in the patch hierarchy.
     * The user is responsible for all data management for the quantities
     * associated with the solution and right-hand-side vectors.  In particular,
     * patch data in these vectors must be allocated prior to calling this
     * method.
     *
     * \param x solution vector
     * \param b right-hand-side vector
     *
     * <b>Conditions on Parameters:</b>
     * - vectors \a x and \a b must have same patch hierarchy
     * - vectors \a x and \a b must have same structure, depth, etc.
     *
     * \note The vector arguments for solveSystem() need not match those for
     * initializeSolverState().  However, there must be a certain degree of
     * similarity, including:\par
     * - hierarchy configuration (hierarchy pointer and range of levels)
     * - number, type and alignment of vector component data
     * - ghost cell widths of data in the solution \a x and right-hand-side \a b
     *   vectors
     *
     * \note The solver need not be initialized prior to calling solveSystem();
     * however, see initializeSolverState() and deallocateSolverState() for
     * opportunities to save overhead when performing multiple consecutive
     * solves.

     * \brief Compute hierarchy dependent data required for solving \f$Ax=b\f$.
     *
     * By default, the solveSystem() method computes some required hierarchy
     * dependent data before solving and removes that data after the solve.  For
     * multiple solves that use the same hierarchy configuration, it is more
     * efficient to:
     *
     * -# initialize the hierarchy-dependent data required by the solver via
     *    initializeSolverState(),
     * -# solve the system one or more times via solveSystem(), and
     * -# remove the hierarchy-dependent data via deallocateSolverState().
     *
     * Note that it is generally necessary to reinitialize the solver state when
     * the hierarchy configuration changes.

     * \param x solution vector
